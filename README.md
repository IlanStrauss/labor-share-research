# U.S. Labor Share of GDP: A Methodological Research Note

## Executive Summary

**The "declining labor share" narrative is methodologically sensitive.** Different measurement approaches yield dramatically different conclusions about whether labor's share of national income has declined.

---

## 🔑 Key Findings

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gross labor share (compensation/GDI) increased** from 49.5% (1929) to 51.9% (2024) | The long-run trend is *up*, not down |
| **Decline is real from 1970 peak** (58.4%) to 2024 (51.9%) | ~6.5 pp decline over 54 years |
| **Net labor share has *increased*** when accounting for rising depreciation | Depreciation rose from 10% to 16.5% of GDI |
| **Wages fell but benefits rose more** | Wages: 48.6% → 42.8%; Benefits: 0.9% → 9.1% |
| **Proprietors' income collapsed** from 13.5% to 7.0% | Confounds labor share measurement |
| **Corporate profits rose modestly** from 10.2% to 11.5% | +1.3 pp over 95 years |

## ⚠️ Points to Consider

### Methodological Choices That Change the Story

1. **Time Period Selection**
   - 1929–2024: Labor share *increased* +2.4 pp
   - 1970–2024: Labor share *declined* ~6.5 pp
   - Post-2000: Decline accelerated

2. **Gross vs Net Measures**
   - Gross measures include depreciation in the denominator
   - Net measures (subtracting depreciation) show less/no decline
   - Depreciation cannot be consumed—net measures may better reflect welfare

3. **Treatment of Proprietors' Income**
   - Mixed income (self-employed) is part labor, part capital
   - Different imputation methods swing measured labor share by ~10 pp
   - Corporate sector focus avoids this but misses large portion of economy

4. **GDP vs GNP/GNI**
   - GDP: Production within borders regardless of ownership
   - GNP: Income accruing to residents regardless of location
   - Profit shifting by multinationals makes GDP-based measures potentially misleading

5. **Wages vs Total Compensation**
   - Wage-only measures show clear decline
   - Total compensation (including benefits) shows much less decline
   - Health insurance costs have shifted from wages to benefits

## 🔬 Methodological Approaches

### Approach 1: Gross Labor Share (Standard)

**Formula:** `Labor Share = Compensation of Employees / Gross Domestic Income`

**Pros:**
- Simple, widely used
- Directly from national accounts

**Cons:**
- Includes depreciation which cannot be consumed
- Sensitive to capital intensity changes

**Result:** Modest decline from 1970 peak; increase since 1929

### Approach 2: Net Labor Share

**Formula:** `Net Labor Share = Compensation / (GDI - Depreciation)`

**Calculation:**
| Year | Compensation | Depreciation | NDI | Net Labor Share |
|------|--------------|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| 1929 | 49.5% | 10.0% | 90.0% | **55.0%** |
| 2024 | 51.9% | 16.5% | 83.5% | **62.2%** |

**Pros:**
- Better reflects distributable income
- Accounts for rising capital intensity

**Cons:**
- Depreciation measurement controversial
- Less commonly reported

**Result:** Labor share has *increased* on net basis

### Approach 3: With Proprietors' Income Adjustment

**Formula:** `Adjusted Labor Share = (Compensation + α × Proprietors' Income) / GDI`

Where α = assumed labor share of proprietors' income (typically 0.5–0.75)

**Calculation (α = 0.67):**
| Year | Compensation | Proprietors' | Adjusted Labor Share |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1929 | 49.5% | 13.5% | 49.5 + 9.0 = **58.5%** |
| 2024 | 51.9% | 7.0% | 51.9 + 4.7 = **56.6%** |

**Pros:**
- Accounts for self-employment income
- More comprehensive measure

**Cons:**
- Requires arbitrary assumption about α
- Self-employment has changed character

**Result:** Modest decline (~2 pp) vs unadjusted increase

### Approach 4: Corporate Sector Only

Focus exclusively on corporate sector to avoid proprietors' income imputation.

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of labor vs capital
- No imputation required

**Cons:**
- Misses large portion of economy
- Corporate share has grown (composition effect)

**Result:** Clearer decline (~5 pp since 1975 per Karabarbounis & Neiman)

### Approach 5: GNP/GNI-Based Measure

**Formula:** `Labor Share = Compensation / Gross National Income`

**Rationale:**
- GNI = GDP + Net Factor Income from Abroad
- Attributes income to residents, not production location
- Adjusts for multinational profit shifting

**For U.S.:** NFIA is positive but small (~0.5-1% of GDP), so GNI > GDP. This would *slightly increase* measured labor share.

**Result:** Minor adjustment for U.S.; more significant for small open economies (Ireland, etc.)

## 📚 Literature Review

### Seminal Papers

| Paper | Key Argument |
|-------|--------------|
| **Karabarbounis & Neiman (2014)** | Global labor share declined ~5 pp since 1975; driven by falling price of investment goods |
| **Gollin (2002)** | Self-employment income adjustment eliminates apparent cross-country differences |
| **Rognlie (2015)** | Most of capital share increase is housing; net capital share stable |
| **Bridgman (2018)** | Net labor share shows minimal decline when accounting for depreciation |
| **Koh et al. (2020)** | IPP capitalization (post-2013 NIPA revision) explains entire decline |
| **Barkai (2020)** | Both labor AND capital shares declined; pure profits (markups) increased |

### Key Debates

1. **Is the decline real?**
   - Yes: Corporate sector shows clear decline
   - Partially: Depends on time period and measure
   - No: Net measures and long-run comparisons show stability/increase

2. **What caused any decline?**
   - Technology (automation, IT investment)
   - Globalization (~11% of decline per McKinsey)
   - Rising markups/market power
   - Decline in unionization
   - Superstar firms effect

3. **Does it matter for welfare?**
   - Gross vs net distinction crucial
   - Benefits vs wages distinction matters
   - Distribution within labor income may matter more

```

### Calculations

Net labor share calculation:
```
Net Domestic Income = GDI × (1 - Depreciation Share)
Net Labor Share = Compensation Share / (1 - Depreciation Share)

Example (2024):
NDI = 100% × (1 - 0.165) = 83.5%
Net Labor Share = 51.9% / 83.5% = 62.2%
```

Proprietors' income adjustment:
```
Adjusted Labor Share = Compensation Share + (α × Proprietors' Share)
Where α = assumed labor fraction (typically 0.67)

Example (2024):
Adjusted = 51.9% + (0.67 × 7.0%) = 56.6%
```
